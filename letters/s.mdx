Serverless allows to you run back end code, as a service, on demand, without having to worry about the cost and overheads of managing your own physical or virtual servers.

What’s more, when you use serverless functions on Netlify, we take care of increasing the number of servers available when your website traffic grows — which is called scaling. 

Use serverless functions to make API calls to databases or content management systems  — or anything else you can think of!
