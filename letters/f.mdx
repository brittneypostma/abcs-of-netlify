Any static form can be magically powered up by Netlify with no backend setup required. Add the `data-netlify=”true"` attribute to your form and give it a name, then add a hidden text input field with a `name=”form-name”` attribute and a value attribute equal to the same name you gave your form. Deploy your site to Netlify and you have a fully functioning contact system with no server-side code or extra JavaScript required. There’s even extra attributes that allow for built in bot detection or recaptcha inputs.
