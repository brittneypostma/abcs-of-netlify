Imagine your product as a puzzle made up of lots of different pieces that each do different jobs. You might have a content management system, a payment system, a shopping catalogue and an email platform that all fit together with your website to make your customers happy.

Composable is a type of architecture, and it means choosing the best tools and services for your product, making it easy to switch them out easily later if you need to.
