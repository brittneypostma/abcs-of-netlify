The Jamstack is a way to build applications. It decouples the visual layer from the data and business logic. This makes your apps more flexible, scalable, and maintainable. It makes them more performant and brings them to the modern age of web development and beyond. It enables you to  compose custom logic and 3rd party services and piece them together to allow you to choose the best in class or the product specific that fits your needs.
