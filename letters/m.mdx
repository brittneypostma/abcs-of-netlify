M is for Middleware

Middleware is the stuff that runs before a request is completed between the server and the client. With Next.js Advanced middleware, powered by Netlify Edge Functions you can change headers, rewrite the request path, or transform the response entirely. This is only available on Netlify by installing the `@netlify/next` package.
