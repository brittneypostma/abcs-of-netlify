Netlify Graph that is. It enables you to integrate with third-party APIs and services with a nice GraphQL interface. No more writing and configuring API specific code. Just connect the API you want to use from the list of services, select an example query or create your own, and then run the query all right in the interface. To work with it locally, you can use the Netlify CLI to generate the handler functions from the queries in the Graph Explorer.
