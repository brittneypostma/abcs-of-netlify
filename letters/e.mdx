A CDN or content delivery network is a global network of servers optimized for serving static assets to users. Edge Functions allow you to execute functions from the CDN server closest to the user. Edge Functions are very much like serverless functions. You can write them using JavaScript or TypeScript. On Netlify, they are powered by Deno, an open source runtime built on web standards.
