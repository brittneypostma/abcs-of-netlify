API is short for Application Programming Interface, which is a way to communicate between different software services. 

There are different types of APIs, and on Netlify, you'll most probably be working with Web APIs.

A web API is a set of tools that allow developers to send and receive instructions and data to and from web servers to build applications.
Netlify even has their own API you can use to manage your sites and deployments.
